# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet

## Background

![Images/1-Logo.png]

This project simulates a real-world scenario with the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**. The goal is to build interactive tools that visualize earthquake data collected globally. Using **Leaflet.js**, we plot real-time earthquake data along with tectonic plate boundaries, using heatmaps and marker clusters to enhance visibility.

The primary goal of this project is to help communicate seismic activity effectively to the public and government organizations, emphasizing the importance of natural hazard monitoring.

## Project Goals

1. **Visualize Earthquake Data**: Display real-time earthquake data using **Leaflet.js**.
2. **Integrate Heatmaps and Clustering**: Add layers to visualize intensity and distribution.
3. **Analyze Patterns with Tectonic Plates**: Overlay tectonic plate boundaries to correlate seismic activity.
4. **Layer Controls and Multiple Base Maps**: Provide interactive controls for switching between data layers and basemap styles.
